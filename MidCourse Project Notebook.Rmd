The analysis will solely focus on loan applications for the purpose of 'Home Purchase' (loan_purpose == 1)

```{r}
mortgage_loan <- loan %>%
  filter(loan_purpose == 1) %>%
  mutate(loan_app_denied = ifelse(action_taken==3,1,0)) %>%
  mutate(debt_to_income_group = case_when(
    debt_to_income_ratio == "30%-<36%" ~ "30%-<40%",
    as.numeric(debt_to_income_ratio) %in% 36:39 ~ "30%-<40%",
    as.numeric(debt_to_income_ratio) %in% 40:49 ~ "40%-<50%",
    TRUE ~ debt_to_income_ratio
    ))
```

```{r}
mortgage_loan_summary <- 
  mortgage_loan %>% 
  group_by(derived_race) %>%
  summarize(application_count = n(), denial_count = sum(loan_app_denied)) %>%
  mutate(pct_denial = 100*denial_count/application_count)

mortgage_loan_debt_summary <-
  mortgage_loan %>% 
  group_by(derived_race, debt_to_income_group) %>%
  summarize(application_count = n())
```


```{r}

  ggplot(aes(y=derived_race, x=pct_denial, fill=derived_race)) +
  geom_col() 

mortgage_loan_debt_summary %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=derived_race, x=debt_to_income_group)) +
